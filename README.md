# rollbot_timer
I used a RollBot as a timing device for other RollBots racing by hanging it above the racetrack. The timing RollBot uses its five IR-sensors to sense when a racing RollBot passes. A timestamp is then made and another timestamp is made when the racing RollBot passes a second, third, and so on time. Each time the lap time is presented via the serial port.
